 Git
        Git is a distributed version control system. It helps developers track changes to source code during software development. Here are some key points about Git:
VersionControl: 
            Git keeps a history of changes, allowing you to revert to previous versions if needed.
Branching and Merging: 
           You can create branches to work on different features or fixes independently and then merge them back into the main codebase.
Collaboration:
           Multiple developers can work on the same project simultaneously without interfering with each other's work.
GitHub
      GitHub is a web-based platform that uses Git for version control. It provides a collaborative environment for developers. Here are some key features of GitHub:
Repositories: 
      GitHub hosts repositories where your project's code and history are stored.
Collaboration Tools: It offers tools like pull requests, issues, and project boards to facilitate collaboration and project management.
Social Coding: 
       Developers can follow each other, star repositories, and contribute to open-source projects.
Use Cases:
      Source Code Management: Both Git and GitHub are primarily used to manage and track changes in source code.
Collaboration:
         They enable multiple developers to work together on the same project efficiently.
Open Source Projects:
         GitHub is widely used for hosting open-source projects, allowing anyone to contribute.
Example Workflow
Clone a Repository:
         Copy a repository from GitHub to your local machine.
Create a Branch:    
         Create a new branch to work on a feature.
Commit Changes:
         Save changes to the branch.
Push Changes:
         Push the branch to GitHub.
Create a Pull Request:
         Open a pull request on GitHub to merge the changes into the main branch.

This is a high-level overview of Git and GitHub. They are powerful tools that significantly enhance the software development process
